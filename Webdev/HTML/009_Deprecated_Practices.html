Certainly! Deprecated elements and attributes are HTML elements and attributes that have been marked as outdated and not recommended for use in modern web development. They might still work in most browsers, but they are not part of the current HTML specification and can cause compatibility issues, accessibility problems, and difficulties in maintaining and styling your code. Here are some other deprecated elements and attributes, along with their modern alternatives:

Deprecated Elements:

<applet> and <object> for Embedding Content:
