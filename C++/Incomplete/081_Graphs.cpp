/*
    Graph - Nonlinear aggregation of nodes and edges.
    Nodes, or vertices, are connected by edges.
    An edge connects two nodes together, representing a relationship between them.


    Undirected graph - nodes have bidirectional edges. Example - social network of friends
    Directed graph - contains edges that link one node to another in one-way connections

    Edges can have weights, representing the cost or distance between nodes.

    Adjacency matrix
    2D array in which each column and row represents a node.
    The value at [i][j] represents an edge between node i and j.
    Runtime complexity of finding an edge - O(1)
    Space complexity is O(V^2)

    Adjacency list
    An array or vector of lists, where each index represents a node.
    The linked list at that index contains the nodes it is connected to.
    Runtime complexity - O(V)
    Space complexity - O(V + E)
