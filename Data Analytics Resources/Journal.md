Starting the google data analytics certificate capstone project.

I hope to learn how to do proper case studies on datasets, so that I can either grow a portfolio or pass an interview. The most important skill I want to learn is to see a case study through to the end.

I look forward most to demonstrating my ability to cohesively package all the information I have gathered so far in a way that displays I have sufficiently learned enough to land a job in the field.

Issues I might encounter are letting other things get in the way and not knowing how to finish what I have started.
