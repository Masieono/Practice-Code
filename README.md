## My Practice Code Repository

This is a dump for all of the coding tutorials I have done.

I have followed along with [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) for his [C++ full course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TkoO8Z07hI&t=9414s&ab_channel=BroCode). The biggest of shout outs to his channel for all of the free information. You can find follow-along files within [this](https://github.com/Masieono/Practice-Code/tree/f5f82d148044b247aa8c0527e97f94a03bce3eaa/C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B%20101) repository.

Bro Code also has a course on [data structures and algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYHwZcbD-s&list=PLZPZq0r_RZON03iKBjYOsOKr1-TD7z2lH&index=26&ab_channel=BroCode), however all of his code implementations are in Java. [My repository](https://github.com/Masieono/Practice-Code/tree/f5f82d148044b247aa8c0527e97f94a03bce3eaa/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms) has all of the lessons in C++ implementations with a moderate amount of commenting for anyone who would find the files useful.

There is also a repository for [etudes](https://github.com/Masieono/Practice-Code/tree/c2ec52e036ebc60fa0357cd4f185f3008a861c67/C%2B%2B/Etudes) that I would work on alongside the previously mentioned C++ tutorials. Whenever I would come to understand a lesson in greater detail, I would try to apply the lesson into a slightly bigger project that involves multiple concepts. All of these files should be pretty self-explanatory.
